## 🔗 Chain System

### What Chains Are
Chains are **sequences of related activities** that you do together, like:
- Morning routine: Coffee → Exercise → Shower
- Work session: Planning → Deep work → Break
- Evening wind-down: Dinner → Walk → Reading

### Using Chains
1. **Create manually** or **let the app suggest** based on your patterns
2. **Apply to any time** by clicking "Apply" on a chain
3. **Automatic scheduling**: The app finds the best available slots
4. **Flow patterns**: Choose waterfall, spiral, ripple, or wave animations

## 📊 Pattern Learning

### How It Learns
The app analyzes your behavior to understand:
- **Peak performance hours**: When you're most productive
- **Energy patterns**: Which activities work best at different times
- **Success sequences**: Activity combinations that work well together
- **Break timing**: Optimal rest periods for your rhythm

### Insights You'll Get
- **"You're most productive 9-11am"**: Schedule important work then
- **"Crystal→Water→Mist works best"**: Follow this activity flow
- **"Take 15-minute breaks"**: Your optimal recovery time
- **"Chains improve productivity 40%"**: Use more routine sequences

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Visual Themes
The app automatically adjusts throughout the day:
- **Morning (6am-12pm)**: Warm orange/yellow sunrise tints
- **Afternoon (12pm-6pm)**: Cool blue daylight tints  
- **Evening (6pm-12am)**: Purple/indigo sunset tints
- **Night (12am-6am)**: Dark/muted nighttime tints

### Energy Types
- **🌅 Sunrise**: High energy, sharp focus (morning workouts, planning)
- **☀️ Daylight**: Steady energy, sustained work (meetings, projects)  
- **🌙 Moonlight**: Low energy, gentle activities (reading, relaxing)

### Flow States
- **💎 Crystal**: Focused, structured activities (writing, coding, studying)
- **🌊 Water**: Creative, flowing activities (brainstorming, art, music)
- **💨 Mist**: Light, restorative activities (breaks, walks, meditation)
