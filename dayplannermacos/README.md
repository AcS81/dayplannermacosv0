# ðŸŒŠ Day Planner: Liquid Glass

A productivity app that feels like liquid glass - translucent, responsive, and alive. Plan your day by manipulating time through crystal clear surfaces.

## âœ¨ What Makes This Special

- **Liquid Glass Interface**: Every surface feels like touching water
- **Three Glass Panels**: Morning Mist, Afternoon Flow, Evening Glow  
- **Floating AI Orb**: Your intelligent companion that responds like liquid mercury
- **Chain Waterfalls**: Activity sequences that cascade down glass surfaces
- **Local AI**: Completely private, runs on your Mac via LM Studio

## ðŸŽ¯ The Experience

Instead of complex menus and settings, you interact with **3 simple glass surfaces**:

1. **Today Glass** - Your main day view with translucent time panels
2. **AI Orb** - Floating sphere for voice and text AI interaction  
3. **Flow Glass** - Side panel with chains and patterns

Every touch creates ripples, every action flows like liquid, every response emerges like aurora lights.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

This isn't another productivity app with endless features. It's a **focused tool** that uses liquid glass as both metaphor and interface:

- **Fluid**: Interactions flow naturally like water
- **Transparent**: Always see what's happening
- **Responsive**: Every touch creates immediate visual feedback  
- **Beautiful**: Glass effects that feel magical yet functional
- **Simple**: Only show what you need, when you need it

## ðŸ”® Vision

Imagine touching your daily schedule and watching time blocks flow like mercury between morning, afternoon, and evening. Speak to an AI orb that responds with aurora-like patterns. See your activity chains cascade down glass panels like waterfalls.

This is productivity software that **feels alive**.
