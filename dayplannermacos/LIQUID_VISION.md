# Day Planner: Liquid Glass Vision

## 🌊 Core Philosophy: Fluid Intelligence

A day planner that feels like liquid glass - translucent, responsive, and alive. Every interaction should feel like manipulating light through crystal clear water.

## ✨ The Liquid Glass Experience

### Visual Language
- **Translucent Layers**: Multiple glass panes that reveal context beneath
- **Fluid Motion**: Smooth, physics-based animations that respond to touch
- **Dynamic Blur**: Background content softly blurs to focus attention
- **Liquid Reflections**: Subtle light reflections that follow cursor movement
- **Breathing UI**: Elements that gently pulse and flow with system rhythm

### Core Interaction Model
```
Touch Glass → Ripple Effect → Content Emerges → Action Completes → Glass Settles
```

#### 2. AI Glass (Floating Orb)
- Translucent sphere that follows cursor
- Expands when spoken to
- Contracts to show thinking
- Pulses with voice input
- Dissolves suggestions like morning dew

#### 3. Flow Glass (Side Panel)
- Chains that cascade like waterfalls
- Routines that spiral like whirlpools  
- Goals that shimmer like mirages
- All emerge when needed, fade when not

## 🏗️ Technical Foundation

### SwiftUI + Metal for Glass Effects
```swift
struct LiquidGlassView: View {
    @State private var glassOpacity: Double = 0.8
    @State private var ripplePhase: Double = 0
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // Background blur layer
            VisualEffectBlur(material: .hudWindow, blendingMode: .behindWindow)
            
            // Content layer with liquid distortion
            ContentView()
                .modifier(LiquidDistortion(phase: ripplePhase))
            
            // Glass reflection layer
            ReflectionLayer()
                .opacity(glassOpacity)
        }
        .onHover { hovering in
            withAnimation(.spring(response: 0.6)) {
                glassOpacity = hovering ? 1.0 : 0.8
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### AI Integration (Simplified)
- **Single AI Call**: One model, one purpose - daily planning
- **Streaming Glass**: Responses emerge like ink in water
- **Confidence Ripples**: Uncertainty shows as glass disturbance

### Data (Crystal Clear)
```swift
// Only 3 core types needed
struct TimeBlock: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let title: String
    let start: Date
    let duration: TimeInterval
    let energy: EnergyType // 🌅☀️🌙
    let flow: FlowState   // 💎🌊☁️
}

struct Chain: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let blocks: [TimeBlock]
    let pattern: FlowPattern // waterfall, spiral, ripple
}

struct Day: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let date: Date
    let blocks: [TimeBlock]
    let mood: GlassMood // clear, cloudy, stormy, prismatic
}
```

## 🎨 Liquid Glass Design System

### Materials
```swift
enum GlassMaterial {
    case crystal    // Ultra clear for focus items
    case mist       // Soft blur for background
    case prism      // Rainbow refractions for celebration
    case water      // Fluid motion for transitions
    case ice        // Crisp edges for precision
}
```

### Animations
```swift
enum LiquidMotion {
    case ripple     // Touch response
    case flow       // Content emergence  
    case settle     // Return to rest
    case breathe    // Idle pulsing
    case cascade    // Content removal
}
```

### Colors
- **Primary**: Dynamic glass tints that shift with time of day
- **Secondary**: Soft environmental reflections
- **Accent**: Liquid mercury for active states
- **Background**: Deep space with subtle star fields
